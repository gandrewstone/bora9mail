<h3>How is Bora9Mail different?</h3>

<p><div id="wrapper">
  <div id="content">
There's an old saying "If you are not the customer, you are the product".  With other email systems, the content of your messages are analyzed and used to make money.

With Bora9Mail, you really are the customer.  All your messages, sent and received, are encrypted in the web browser.  In fact your password and encryption keys are never sent to the server.  It is even possible to store your data exclusively on your local devices, except for the knowledge that you exist (this information is used to stop double registrations and enqueue incoming messages).  This "lock to device" feature makes it impossible for some hacker halfway around the world to crack into your account by guessing your password; they also need the data stored exclusively on your devices.  <span style="highlight">But with true privacy comes responsibility -- if you lose your password it is literally impossible for Bora9Mail to recover your account or any of your messages.</span>

  <div id="content">Nothing worth having is free in this world, and that includes Bora9Mail.  However, by using the digital currency Bitcoin, Bora9Mail makes sure that you pay for only what you use; typically a few pennies per day.  More importantly, rather then paying in advance for a service you may not use Bitcoin's efficient micro-payments allow you to pay as you go.  <p>As an added benefit, Bora9Mail also uses Bitcoin payments for spam prevention, saving you time and giving strangers who really need to contact you a means to do so (they include a small payment in their initial email).</p>

<h3>Why was Bora9Mail created?</h3>
<p><div id="wrapper">
  <div id="content">Even if you are not a criminal every person at some time in their lives has something that they would rather remain confidential for a time.  
It could be good news like a college acceptance or a pregnancy that needs to be announced at the proper time.  It could be sad news like a medical condition that may affect how people treat you or perceive your employability.  It could be a political, religious or sexual orientation that your acquaintances or the larger society you live in does not accept.

Of course, you may be committing a crime and not even know it.  There are 37,000 legal acts in the EU, 13,000 Court verdicts and 52,000 international standards, all of which must be respected by citizens and companies.<a href="http://en.euabc.com/word/2152">ref</a>  The United States has been asked and refused to count the number of federal crimes (too much effort), but that number is estimated to be least 4450.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Code">ref</a>  And these are only the crimes.  The full United States Code consists of 51 very thick volumes (at the left).  But before you crack those 20000+ pages, understand that the Code isn't authortative.  The true authortative reference is the entire output of the US legislative process.  No one can possibly learn all these laws, yet ignorance of a law is typically not a valid defense.  To the extent that most laws are very reasonable, most of us will certainly follow them once we learn of their existence and likely attempt to make private redress for any previous mistakes (AKA "I'm sorry!").

At the same time, I doubt that any of us want potential evidence of lawbreaking held in servers and backups for the 5-10 year duration of a typical statute of limitations.<a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/statute-of-limitations-state-laws-chart-29941.html">ref</a> Is it wrong for us to feel that way?  Without privacy, law enforcement has the potential to become "the Eye of Sauron".  Attract its notice and law enforcement automated algorithms might mine 10+ years of prior personal communications for the breaking of any one of 100000+ minor laws and putting you into an all-consuming world of paperwork and court appearances.  I think that the current social construction did not anticipate that possibility and if it did the structure of the legal system would be very different.

Privacy is integral to the functioning of a democracy, at the very least to protect your right to vote your conscience without coersion.  In fact, in 2008 President Barack Obama said that Americans will be able to leave behind the era of George W. Bush, Dick Cheney and "wiretaps without warrants," <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/obama-no-warrantless-wiretaps-if-you-elect-me/">ref</a>.

But that's not what happened. Instead it seems that the program was massively expanded to cover all forms of communication.  There are so many reported instances of warrantless wiretapping recently that is has become almost boring to report them.  Here are two:

The Guardian <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/jun/06/verizon-telephone-data-court-order">released a classified court order</a> requiring Verizon to turn over records of all domestic phone calls to the National Security Agency.
<br>
A classified PowerPoint presentation leaked by Edward Snowden states that PRISM enables "collection directly from the servers" of Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook and other online companies.  How much is captured? FISA orders are not search warrants under the Fourth Amendment, and the FISA Amendments Act doesn't require the government to show probable cause to believe that the target of surveillance has committed a crime.
<br>

<italic>In sum, collection is no longer protected by the legal process</italic>

Even if you do not care about your rights under the fourth amendment (or equivalent document in your country), these routine abuses by law enforcement and the use of judical gag orders to hide them are worrisome.  Law enforcement is made up of a large and diverse group of individuals, and in any such group you must ask yourself:

<h2>Can all the "good guys" be trusted to be good?</h2>

Between 1963 and 1965, the FBI bugged at least 14 hotel rooms of Martin Luther King, Jr., seeking "information concerning King's personal activities" to "discredit him."<a href="http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/book2/html/ChurchB2_0118b.htm">ref</a>

Did you know that crooked police officers use FBI databases for personal gain and criminal intent?<a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/nyc-cases-show-crooked-cops-abuse-fbi-database">ref</a>

NSA employees have been reprimanded for abusing their access to the agency’s massive global spy network. The practice has become so widespread over the last ten years, government employees have given the practice a name – Love Intelligence.  Not a single federal employee was criminally charged for their actions or even fired. <a href="http://www.whiteoutpress.com/articles/q42013/feds-admit-abusing-nsa-spy-authority-for-stalking/">ref</a>

But even if you trust all members of law enforcement, "You can't build a "back door" that only the good guys can walk through." Bruce Schneier (<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/01/23/schneier.google.hacking/index.html">1</a>,<a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/security/the-athens-affair">2</a>,<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/14/telecom_italia_spying_probe_update">3</a>


I am a normal, law-abiding citizen.  But I have come to one simple conclusion:<strong><italic>You must protect your own right to privacy</italic></strong>
