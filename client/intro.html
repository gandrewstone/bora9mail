<h3>How is Bora9Mail different?</h3>

<p><div id="wrapper">
  <div id="content">
There's an old saying "If you are not the customer, you are the product".  With other email systems, the content of your messages are analyzed and used to make money.

With Bora9Mail, you really are the customer.  All your messages, sent and received, are encrypted in the web browser.  In fact your password and encryption keys are never sent to the server.  It is even possible to store your data exclusively on your local devices, except for the knowledge that you exist (this information is used to stop double registrations and enqueue incoming messages).  This "lock to device" feature makes it impossible for some hacker halfway around the world to crack into your account by guessing your password; they also need the data stored exclusively on your devices.  <span style="highlight">But with true privacy comes responsibility -- if you lose your password it is literally impossible for Bora9Mail to recover your account or any of your messages.</span>

  <div id="content">Nothing worth having is free in this world, and that includes Bora9Mail.  However, by using the digital currency Bitcoin, Bora9Mail makes sure that you pay for only what you use; typically a few pennies per day.  More importantly, rather then paying in advance for a service you may not use Bitcoin's efficient micro-payments allow you to pay as you go.  <p>As an added benefit, Bora9Mail also uses Bitcoin payments for spam prevention, saving you time and giving strangers who really need to contact you a means to do so (they include a small payment in their initial email).</p>
